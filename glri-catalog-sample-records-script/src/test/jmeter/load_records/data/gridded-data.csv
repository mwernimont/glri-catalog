The plankton (phytoplankton and zooplankton) Beneficial Use Impairment (BUI) was so designated because impairment metrics were unavailable or inconclusive. Recent investigations, however, suggest that plankton communities are relatively healthy and no longer threaten the local ecosystem. Thus, the BUI for plankton may now be outdated in all, or parts of, the St. Lawrence River in the Massena AOC. The primary goal for the Massena (and Cornwall) Remedial Action Plan (RAP) (developed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), the Massena Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC), the Canadian governments, the Cornwall Public Advisory Committee (PAC), and the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe at Akwesasne) is to ''restore, protect, and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the St. Lawrence River ecosystem and in particular the Akwesasne, Cornwall-Lake St.Francis and Massena Area of Concern in accordance with the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and other agency laws, regulations, and policies''. The RAP established specific criteria in the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC for delisting (restoring and protecting) the ''Degradation of Phytoplanton and Zooplankton Populations'' BUI. These criteria are: (1) ''phytoplankton or zooplankton community structure does not significantly differ from unimpacted control sites of comparable physical and chemical characteristics'', and (2) ''in the absence of community structure data, plankton bioassays confirm no toxicity impact in ambient waters (i.e. no growth inhibition)''. This study generated toxicity data needed to test hypotheses that (1) waters at all sample locations in the AOC are not toxic to plankton and (2) the toxicity of waters at all sample locations in the AOC are no more toxic to plankton than are waters from upstream control reaches (in three selected main tributaries and in the St. Lawrence River), which are not within the AOC. Toxicity of waters to plankton from all study sites will be quantified by the (a) growth of the green algae species, Selenastrum capricornutum and (b) reproductive capacity (and survival) of Ceriodaphnia dubia using standard United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)guidelines. Statistical analyses that test both hypotheses will be used to determine if waters within the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC meet the second criterion for delisting the plankton BUI.'	Water Toxicity in the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC	The objective of this study is to determine if the phytoplankton and zooplankton beneficial use is impaired, or not impaired, in parts, or all of the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC. Plankton toxicity data will be used, specifically, to test whether waters in this AOC meet established criteria for delisting the plankton BUI.	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	US Environmental Protection Agency	unspecified	NYS Department of Environmental Conservation	unspecified	St. Regis Mohawk Tribe at Akwesasne	unspecified	USGS New York Water Science Center - Estimating chronic toxicity of waters from the St. Lawrence River at Massena Area-of-Concern using two plankton species [project overview]	http://ny.cf.er.usgs.gov/nyprojectsearch/projects/2457-E5211-1.html	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	Completed	2011	2012

The first hypothesis is that bed sediments at selected sample locations in the AOC (in three tributaries and in the St. Lawrence River) are no more toxic to the test species than bed sediments collected from control sites located outside (generally upstream from) the AOC. Acute (survival) and chronic (growth) whole bed-sediment toxicity tests  will be conducted using the midge (Chironomus dilutus), following standard methods (USEPA 1994; USEPA 2000). The second hypothesis is that the benthic macroinvertebrate communities from targeted sites within the AOC are not significantly different, or are affected (impacted) no more seriously than the communities encountered at reference (control) sites located outside the AOC according to spatial patterns in benthic community composition (nonparametric ordination) and the Biological Assessment Profile (BAP) index and component metrics for Ponar samples collected from soft bed sediments (fig. 1) developed by NY State Department of Environmental Conservation (Bode et al. 2002; Smith et al. 2009).

The mean score of the five indices denotes the overall BAP and associated impact for each site. Although several bed sediment-collection methods are suitable, the Petite Ponar sampler will be used to collect 5 replicate macroinvertebrate-community samples and a single composite sample for bed sediment toxicity tests at each study site.

The second phase will consist of macroinvertebrate identification, sediment toxicity testing, data analysis and interpretation, and report preparation and review mainly during FY2014. In brief, we will generate bed sediment toxicity and benthic community data needed to test two related hypotheses that address the two criteria for delisting the benthos BUI.

Three Priority Watersheds have been targeted by the Regional Working Group’s Phosphorus Reduction Work Group (Fox/Green Bay, Saginaw, and Maumee) and are characterized by having a high density of agricultural land use and have ecosystem impairments that have been clearly identified. Within the Saginaw River Priority Watersheds, monitoring is being conducted at the sub-watershed, edge-of-field, and subsurface-tile scale. The edge-of-field and subsurface-tile monitoring stations are targeted to those areas within each watershed that will be directly affected by the conservation efforts. These sites will allow for a rapid assessment of conservation implementation as the water quality from those locations are immediately affected by land-use and management changes and represent the major pathways for non-point pollution to enter receiving streams.  Relationships between the small to sub-watershed scale will help develop an understanding on how conservation efforts may impact the watershed as a whole.

This information will help guide restoration efforts to achieve maximum effectiveness and success. Project provides unified information across the Great Lakes Basin for ecosystem restoration, assessment, and management by incorporating models that relate changes in landscape and hydrologic variables and stresses to changes in ecosystem function.  The project relies upon regionally consistent hydrologic, biologic, and geospatial data to generate regionally consistent estimates, models, and analysis. USGS is the Circular A-16 theme lead for hydrographic spatial data.  As such USGS has responsibility to coordinate with other federal agencies, states, and other entities the development and stewardship of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD).  USGS also has developed in partnership with EPA the NHDPlus, it has a memorandum of understanding with The Nature Conservancy to study environmental flows and impacts of hydrologic alterations on ecology.  USGS has been a lead agency in the development of techniques and methods to estimate streamflow characteristics in gaged and ungaged watersheds and in developing, applying, and coordinating research in ecology and hydroecology. Products from this research will include a consistent hydrologic dataset of the US Great Lakes Basin built on the 1:100,000 NHDplus and attributed with landscape and aquatic ecologic variables.  Empirical models developed for fish distribution, temperature, and streamflow will be developed. A hierarchical lotic habitat classification framework and fish-based lotic habitat classification will be built on the hydrologic dataset.	Watershed modeling for stream ecosystem management	Two objectives from this focus area benefit from this research.  The ungaged flow estimates provide key information for assessing tributary streamflow within the Basin.  The major purpose of this work is to provide a common, consistent, framework for stream ecosystem restoration and management.  This framework can be used to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems, provide tools for use in stream ecosystem and watershed restoration, planning, and management; help identify areas in need of protection, conservation, enhancement, and restoration; and provide information for policy makers to make informed decisions on topics that relate to stream ecosystem health.	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) – Watershed Modeling for Stream Ecosystem Management [project overview]	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/accountability/watershed_modeling.html	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	In Progress	2010	2014

On-the-ground studies will be  conducted to find sources of pollution and environmental factors that may create a situation where unhealthy bacteria or viruses can live and pose a threat to public health.  Over 56 beaches across the Great Lakes region, in addition to those currently being monitored, will be included in this effort to help meet goals for healthier beaches. USGS will improve and refine existing beach predictive models, rapid methods, and the identification of sources of fecal contamination, pathogens, and viruses at beaches in the Great Lakes in order to improve beach managers decision-making. This funding would be used enhance existing efforts to advance the science of monitoring and assessing recreational water quality to provide beach managers with reliable, science-based information to make well-informed beach closure decisions to protect public health focusing on: 1) Identifying and evaluating new or rapid methods to improve monitoring of bacteria at beaches; 2) Identifying physical and biological processes that influence the occurrence and abundance of key bacteria and pathogens that pose risks to recreational users of beaches and nearshore waters; 3) Enhancing existing models and expanding models to additional beaches to improve forecasts of water quality and support more timely and effective public health warnings, advisories, and beach closures; 4) Improving communication of monitoring and scientific information and developing tools to enhance response of beach managers to changing beach and water quality.	Enhance Great Lakes beach recreational water quality decision making	Water recreation and associated tourism add billions of dollars to the economy of the Great Lakes Region and provide numerous societal benefits.  There are several problems, however, with the current approach to establishing beach closures and advisories.  First, current beach monitoring practices rely on methods for culturing fecal-indicator bacteria that take 18-24 hours for results, too long to provide information on current water-quality conditions.  Secondly, sources of fecal contamination in recreational waters are often unknown and/or of nonpoint origins.  The relations between coastal processes (sediment transport and storage, ground-water/surface-water interactions, wave actions, seiches, etc.) and bacteria concentrations have not been comprehensively studied in the Great Lakes. Development of methods that discriminate between human and animal nonpoint-source fecal contamination are needed to help identify risks associated with contaminated recreational waters.  Finally, recreational waters are seldom monitored for pathogens, which often have different transport and survival properties than the fecal-indicator bacteria used to indicate their presence.	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) - Enhance Great Lakes beach recreational water quality decision making [project overview]	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/nearshore_health/beach_water_quality.html	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/nearshore_health/beach_water_quality.html	Environmental Data Discovery and Transformation (EnDDaT) Service	http://cida.usgs.gov/enddat/	In Progress	2010	2014

Total annual phosphorus and total suspended sediment loads will be estimated at various monitored locations throughout the Upper Fox and Wolf River Watershed using a rating curve method or GCLAS with streamflow monitored by the USGS and water quality data collected by the Wisconsin DNR.  Monitoring at three new sites was done as part of this study. Data from these three sites will be used to help calibrate the SWAT model for the basin. These loads will be supplied to the Cadmus Group, Inc. to help calibrate SWAT models for the Basin.  A detailed water budget will be developed for the Pool Lakes by measuring all major inflow and outflow sources and estimating the magnitude of minor sources. A detailed phosphorus budget will be obtained by quantifying the phosphorus loading associated with each water inflow and outflow source. Loading at each stream monitoring site will be estimated using a rating curve method or GCLAS with streamflow monitored by the USGS and water quality data collected by the Wisconsin DNR. Loading from ungaged areas will be obtained from the SWAT modeling being performed in the basin as part of separate studies by Cadmus Group, Inc.  Current water quality (trophic state) of each of the four lakes in the Winnebago Pool will be obtained from the Wisconsin DNR and evaluated relative to long-term trends. The water-quality information will compared to that estimated for the lakes based on the phosphorus loading through the use of selected models in BATHTUB (Walker, 1996). BATHTUB will then be used to simulate the likely response of each of the Pool Lakes to phosphorus loading changes associated with various lake-management actions that might be implemented and specific climate scenarios. Output from the lake to the Lower Fox River will be estimated from data collected by the Wisconsin DNR at Neenah and Menasha and using output from the BATHTUB model. This information will be supplied (as a Final Report/Journal Article) to those developing the TMDL for the Upper Fox River Basin and those modeling the watershed downstream of Lake Winnebago.

Three Priority Watersheds have been targeted by the Regional Working Group’s Phosphorus Reduction Work Group (Fox/Green Bay, Saginaw, and Maumee) and are characterized by having a high density of agricultural land use and have ecosystem impairments that have been clearly identified. Within the Fox River Priority Watershed, monitoring is being conducted at the sub-watershed and edge-of-field scale. The edge-of-field stations are targeted to those areas within each watershed that will be directly affected by the conservation efforts. These sites will allow for a rapid assessment of conservation implementation as the water quality from those locations are immediately affected by land-use and management changes and represent the major pathways for non-point pollution to enter the stream.  Relationships between the smaller to sub-watershed scale will help develop an understanding on how conservation efforts may impact the watershed as a whole. This effort will accelerate quantification of current and ongoing efforts in the Lower Fox GLRI Priority subwatershed with a focus on the smallest scale of implementation (field scale) and is responsive to RWG questions/requests regarding the need to quantify impacts of priority GLRI activities through relevant science and monitoring. USGS will undertake and coordinate a multi-agency effort to predict losses of phosphorus, nitrogen, and sediment from individual fields using established water quality monitoring networks and simulation tools. Results may be scaled-up to examine broader scale effects and reasonable/achievable reductions that can be expected from targeted activities. Coordination among scientists, water quality specialists, and modelers in NRCS, USGS, EPA, and partnering universities is expected.

This project will determine: 1) a quick assay test for the presence of the toxin , 2) how birds are exposed to the toxins, and 3) what factors combined trigger an outbreak.  This information will be used to formulate management strategies. Botulism intoxication is caused by ingestion of neurotoxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum.  Periodic outbreaks of type E botulism have resulted in die-offs of fish and fish-eating birds in the Great Lakes since at least the 1960s, but outbreaks have become more common and widespread since 1999.  Botulism has been responsible for over 100,000 bird deaths on the Great Lakes since 1999, and extensive bird mortality in northern Lake Michigan near Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (SLBE; over 4150 birds in 2007) received widespread press attention and caused great public concern.  The actual sites of toxin exposure for birds remain unknown. Spores of C. botulinum are naturally widely distributed in the environment, but toxin production occurs only when suitable environmental conditions allow spore germination and cell growth, and this may be related to local soil and water conditions.  The physical and ecological factors that are associated with toxin production, waterbird exposure, and botulism outbreaks are poorly understood in the Great Lakes, as in other environments.  Invasive species, particularly dreissenid mussels Dreissena spp. and round gobies Neogobius melanostomus, have been implicated in the recent increased occurrence of botulism mortality in Great Lakes fish and birds, but this has not been proven.  Dreissenid mussels may enhance nearshore algal growth, and decomposing algae may help create the anoxic conditions required for C. botulinum germination. We hypothesize that recent increases in the incidence of type E avian botulism outbreaks in the Great Lakes may be associated with the presence of large amounts of decomposing sloughed Cladophora.  We propose to determine the presence or absence of C. botulinum and type E botulinum toxin in sediments.  In FY 2013, targeted sampling sites will be chosen in northern Lake Michigan near SLBE to represent sites that support varying amounts of sloughed Cladophora at a range of depths throughout the season.  We further propose to use population surveys to assess waterbird distribution, with emphasis on species historically impacted by type E botulism (e.g., Common Loon Gavia immer), to examine the spatial relationships between bird distribution and carcass detection of confirmed botulism mortalities, and to analyze the relation between botulism in birds and environmental conditions at locations where toxin exposure is likely to occur.	Avian botulism in distressed Great Lakes environments	The ultimate goal of this project is to develop management actions to reduce fish and bird mortality during botulism outbreaks.  If, as we suspect, recent increases in botulism outbreaks are due to the presence of large amounts of decomposing algae, the presence of which is due to the effects of dreissenid mussels, then this will represent a reduction in the negative effects of dreissenids on fish and bird populations in the Great Lakes.  However, work funded by this template will gather data that will help reduce the number of beach closure days and will contribute to rapid responses for mock action plans but will not directly meet the measures listed above.	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) - Avian Botulism in Distressed Great Lakes Environments [project overview]	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/habitat_and_wildlife/avian_botulism.html	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	In Progress	2010	unspecified

Geological Survey (USGS) will identify through this project significant sources and impacts of historical and newly emerging toxics to the Great Lakes ecosystem through broad surveillance as well as laboratory and field research of tree swallows and other bird species.  USGS scientists will determine the amount of exposure to and the effects of historical and emerging contaminants in Great Lakes food chains. The data will inform regulators and provide guidance on removal of Beneficial Use Impairments at Area of Concern sites around the Great Lakes.  Work supported under this project is quantifying exposure to, and effects of, both historical and emerging contaminants on Great Lakes food chains using sentinel indicator species such as colonial waterbirds and tree swallows.  Results will contribute directly to assessments of Great Lakes ecosystem health and science-based decision making, provide data that will be directly used by States and EPA to assess whether specific BUIs can be removed and AOC’s subsequently delisted, provide a baseline for future trend analysis, and determine the effectiveness of recent remediation actions at AOCs and other known hotspots.  The tree swallow data provide for a biological matrix that is consistent across all AOCs and allows direct comparisons among AOCs and comparisons to non-AOC locations across not only the Great Lakes, but also the northern tier of states in the U.S. as well as Canada.  Because swallows can be enticed to nest at AOCs with the use of nest boxes, similar data will be available for all AOCs.  Because there are effects thresholds already established for tree swallows, or other avian species, it can be determined directly whether exposures to contaminants of various chemical classes are at or above levels of concern.  The collection of colonial waterbird data, where those species occur, in conjunction with the tree swallow data, will allow for modeling and assessment of possible contaminant effects throughout the aquatic ecosystem.  The limited feeding radius of swallows and close ties to sediment contamination allow for an assessment of the biological availability of sediment contaminants as well as quantification of changes in sediment contamination that will be directly usable by EPA in remedy effectiveness assessments.	Birds as Indicators of Contmainant Exposure in the Great Lakes	Results will contribute directly to assessments of Great Lakes ecosystem health and science-based decision making, provide data that directly contribute to BUI removal and AOC delisting assessments, provide a baseline for future trend analysis, and determine the effectiveness of recent remediation actions at AOCs and other known hotspots.  Specifically, all of the tree swallow and colonial waterbird data can be used directly by States and EPA to determine whether two BUIs – (1) Bird or Animal Deformities or Reproductive Problems and (2) Degradation of Fish and Wildlife Populations – can be removed.  These data are being provided to States and EPA in a format and style that enable their immediate and efficient use.  The tree swallow data can also be used in the remedy effectiveness context, directly and immediately, at those locations when remedies have already been implemented.  Concentrations in tree swallow tissues are being measured pre- and post-dredging to assess remedy effectiveness for biological endpoints.	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) Project 80 - Birds as Indicators of Contaminant Exposure in the Great Lakes	http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/wildlife_toxicology/glri_project80.html	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) -  Birds as Indicators of Contaminant Exposure in the Great Lakes [project overview]	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/toxic_substances/birds_as_indicators.html	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	In Progress	2010	2015

Building tools and infrastructure to support standard data access, efficient data discovery and dynamic mapping of watersheds and their hydrologic properties. Developing decision support tools to enhance scientific investigation or disseminate project findings, for example integrating hydrologic models with real-time data streams in order to assess the potential environmental impacts of climate change on stream water quality.

Enabling Discovery and Access to USGS Great Lakes Scientific Data Through Web-Based Applications	An environmental baseline, mechanisms to test and prioritize restoration investments and tools to measure environmental improvements are critical for planning and understanding the success of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI). Complexity of the Great Lakes ecosystem and the number of partner agencies and organizations monitoring and modeling components of the Great Lakes system requires a robust and comprehensive data integration framework. The USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA) is working with other GLRI partners to develop and implement a GLRI Data Network that will provide efficient access to information collected throughout GLRI. By integrating multidisciplinary monitoring data and computer models that encompass the watershed, airshed, nearshore and deepwater environments of the Great Lakes, the GLRI Data Network will enable policy makers to plan and evaluate restoration activities based on science that holistically represents the Great Lakes system.	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics	http://cida.usgs.gov/	Great Lakes Observation System	http://glos.us/	USGS Wisconsin Information Mapping	http://wi.water.usgs.gov/wim/index.html	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) - Enabling Discovery and Access to USGS Great Lakes Scientific Data Through Web-Based Applications [project overview]	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/accountability/USGS_data_compilation.html	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	unspecified	http://glos.us/	In Progress	2010	2014

Until relatively recently, difficulties with culturing have precluded the use of mayflies as laboratory toxicity testing organisms; however, researchers at Stroud Water Research Center have found parthenogenic species that readily reproduce under laboratory conditions, and researchers at the US EPA EERD laboratory have developed laboratory cultured diets for mayflies that will help to move toward standardization of methods. Recent efforts at the Illinois Natural History Survey built upon these efforts and developed a method for conducting full life-cycle toxicity tests with the mayfly Centroptilum triangulifer using a modification of the EERD laboratory cultured diet. Endpoints for the full life-cycle test included survival to pre-emergent nymph (PEN) stage, number of days to PEN stage, percent emergence, pre-egg-laying live weight, and number of eggs produced. Initial tests were conducted with sodium salts of chloride, sulfate, and nitrate. In acute (96-h) exposures, LC50s for C. triangulifer were approximately one half to two thirds of those generated in our laboratory with Ceriodaphnia dubia. In the full life-cycle chloride test, the most sensitive endpoints were survival to PEN stage, and mean number of days to PEN stage, with a maximum allowable toxicant concentration (MATC) of 267 mg Cl-/L. The fact that major ion toxicity to standard laboratory test organisms like cladocerans, amphipods, and fish, are dependent on the ionic composition of water or an effluent has been well established. Researchers at the US EPA laboratory in Duluth, MN, previously developed statistical models to predict toxicity of high TDS waters to standard test organisms based on ionic composition, and current efforts in that laboratory are aimed at improving the model. It is known that for crustaceans and fish, solutions tend to be more toxic when dominated by particular major ions (i.e., K+, Mg+, HCO3-), and toxicity due to several individual ions, including SO42-, is reduced when solutions contain more than one cation. However, essentially nothing is known about how ionic composition influences responses of C. triangulifer to elevated major ions. Because this mayfly appears to be more sensitive to elevated major ions than other laboratory cultured test organisms, studies with this organism that could contribute to the development of the new ion toxicity model are required.	Toxicity Testing of Mayflies	The goals of this research will include: 1) conducting acute toxicity tests with C. triangulifer to determine how changes in ionic composition impact responses to elevated major ions. Specific interactions will include but not be limited to calcium/chloride and calcium/sulfate, and sodium/potassium; 2) conducting chronic toxicity tests with C. triangulifer to determine if trends observed in acute tests are observed in full life-cycle exposures; 3) continuing previous efforts to conduct acute tests other wild mayfly species to predict chronic effects; and 4) assisting one or more other laboratories in becoming competent with the newly developed full life-cycle test with C. triangulifer with the goal of validating and standardizing the method.	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) - Protectiveness of Water or Sediment Quality Guidelines to Species of Special Concern [project overview]	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/toxic_substances/EPA_toxicity_studies.html	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	In Progress	2012	2014

A standard guide for conducting water-only laboratory toxicity tests with freshwater mussels was approved in 2006 (ASTM 2008a) and provides a tested and validated, consensus-based methodology for conducting acute or chronic water toxicity tests with the early life stages (glochidia and juveniles) of freshwater mussels.  Several recent peer-reviewed scientific publications have presented data on various toxicants (Bringolf et al. 2007a,b,c; Wang et al. 2007a,b,c) generated with this method and demonstrate consistency and reliability in inter-laboratory (round robin) toxicity tests similar to other aquatic organisms (Wang et al. 2007a).  Because sediments are critical to the existence of an already imperiled mussel fauna, assessing the effects of sediment-associated contaminants and evaluating their quality in a more standard approach would enable more effective protection and conservation.	Development and Demonstration of a Sediment Toxicity Test Method with Freshwater Mussels for Assessing Sediment Contaminants in the Great Lakes Basin and within North America	Develop and demonstrate a sediment toxicity test method with native freshwater mussels common to Great Lakes Basin and elsewhere in the United States that may ultimately lead to an ASTM standard guide for conducting whole-sediment toxicity tests with juvenile mussels. Results of this project will also be used to establish methods that can be used in inter-laboratory (ring) testing of sediments with mussels by multiple laboratories.  This project is intended to result in methods that will assist EPA, States and Tribes with the assessment of  contaminated sediments and a determination of their effects on freshwater mussels.	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) - Protectiveness of Water or Sediment Quality Guidelines to Species of Special Concern [project overview]	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/toxic_substances/EPA_toxicity_studies.html	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	Completed	2011	2013

There is considerable uncertainty regarding the toxicity of major ions to aquatic organisms, particularly given the variability of constituents that comprise these effluents. Because the relative toxicity of major ions is highly variable, predicting effects based on conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS) or other composite measures may be simplistic. Furthermore, most of the available information on sensitivity of aquatic organisms to major ions has been derived from short-term laboratory toxicity tests conducted with surrogate species. There is relatively little information on the sensitivity of aquatic insects to elevated major ions. Field studies showed that abundance of mayflies (Ephemeroptera) was significantly lower in streams receiving elevated TDS associated with mountaintop removal and valley fill operations. Based on an extensive survey of central Appalachian streams, the U.S. EPA developed a benchmark for conductivity in areas affected by mountain top and valley fill operations.  However, these analyses have been criticized because of the lack of experimental evidence showing that mayflies and other macroinvertebrates are sensitive to elevated major ions. These experiments will test the hypothesis that elevated levels of major ions will negatively impact benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Experiments will be conducted in stream microcosms to quantify responses of different groups of macroinvertebrates to elevated levels of major ions. The specific ions used in our experiments will be determined after consultation with EPA and USGS researchers.	Microcosms to Evaluate Elevated Major Ions	Ultimately, these data will be used to identify sensitive indicators of TDS impacts and to assist in the determination of safe levels of major ions in aquatic ecosystems. This study will address 2 issues that are critical to the development and validation of standards for major ions associated with high TDS discharges. First, our community-level approach allows us to quantify effects under ecologically realistic conditions for numerous taxa simultaneously. This would contribute to our understanding of differences in sensitivity among macroinvertebrate taxa. Second, our approach allows us to investigate effects on very early instars, something that has been challenging in the previous research on these effluents. It is likely that the unrealistically high LC50 values reported for some species based on laboratory data are a result of conducting experiments with highly tolerant later instars.	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) - Protectiveness of Water or Sediment Quality Guidelines to Species of Special Concern [project overview]	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/toxic_substances/EPA_toxicity_studies.html	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	In Progress	2012	2014

Results of these studies indicate that the acute or chronic sensitivity of rainbow trout, but not fathead minnow, frequently provided protective acute or chronic toxicity thresholds for most of the listed species evaluated. However, only a limited number of species of sculpins or darters were included in this evaluation, and not all species tested occurred in the Great Lakes watershed. The objective of the proposed study will be to: (1) provide additional chronic toxicity data for sculpins or darters indigenous to the Great Lakes to complement the limited chronic toxicity data for pentachlorophenol (PCP) or copper previously reported for darters or for sculpins and (2) provide acute toxicity data for additional chemicals of concern with sculpins, darters, rainbow trout, and fathead minnow. USGS-Columbia will conduct: (1) acute 4-d and chronic 28-d toxicity tests with PCP and mottled sculpins, (2) acute 4-d and chronic 28-d toxicity tests with copper and PCP with fathead minnows (repeating the Besser et al. 2005 study). If additional funding is provided in FY14, USGS Columbia will conduct acute 4-d and chronic 28-d toxicity tests with copper and PCP with an additional darter species of concern in the Great Lakes. The combined results of the previous and new studies would include 4-d acute and 28-d chronic toxicity data sets for PCP and copper for the following species: rainbow trout, fathead minnow (2X), mottled sculpin, fountain darter, and one additional species of darter from the Great Lakes watershed. Acute toxicity tests will also be conducted with up to about six additional chemicals of concern with sculpins, darters, rainbow trout, and fathead minnows. The number of chemicals tested and the number of species of sculpins or darters tested will be dependent on the availability of early life stages of sculpins or darters. Other taxa might be considered if newly hatched young of the desired species of sculpin or darters cannot be obtained. Selection of the species to be tested will be decided based on a review of the literature and on consultations with USEPA Region 5.	Toxicity Testing of Sculpins and Darters	Results of this study will determine the acute or chronic sensitivity of sculpins or darters (warm water species) compared to the commonly tested species of rainbow trout (a cold-water species) or fathead minnow (a warm-water species).	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) - Protectiveness of Water or Sediment Quality Guidelines to Species of Special Concern [project overview]	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/toxic_substances/EPA_toxicity_studies.html	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	In Progress	2013	2015

However, the chronic toxicity of organic chemicals has only been evaluated with a limited number of mussel species or for a limited number of organic chemicals. The objective of this study will be to evaluate methods for conducting 90-d water only exposures with juvenile mussels and conducted chronic 28-d toxicity tests with at least organic chemicals of concern and two commonly tested species of mussels (Lampsilis siliquoidea, fatmucket and Villosa iris, rainbow mussel). If additional funding is available in FY14, two additional chemicals will be tested. Selection of the three organic chemicals to be tested will be decided based on a review of the literature, on the results of ongoing acute toxicity testing of mussels and snails at USGS-Columbia with up to 20 chemicals of concern, and on consultations with USEPA Region 5. Candidate organic chemicals might include pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or polychlorinated biphenyls.	Toxicity of Organic Chemicals in Mussels	Results of this study will provide additional mussel toxicity data for organic chemicals of concern and will provide data that can be used to determine mussel acute-chronic toxicity ratios for select organic chemicals of concern that might be useful for the USEPA or states to develop or refine water quality criteria or standards for these organic chemicals of concern.	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) - Protectiveness of Water or Sediment Quality Guidelines to Species of Special Concern [project overview]	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/toxic_substances/EPA_toxicity_studies.html	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	In Progress	2013	2015

The objective of this new study will be to determine the toxicity of nitrogen compounds to stream-dwelling amphibians. Nitrogen contamination in aquatic systems results from the decomposition of organic matter, as well as through agricultural inputs, sewage effluents and industrial activities. Nitrogen in its various forms is of ecological concern because of its ubiquitous distribution and toxicity to aquatic life. Nitrogen compounds pose a hazard to aquatic larval stages of amphibians, affecting survival and development, and inducing deformities and behavioral impairments. Declines in amphibian populations have been correlated with the prevalence of nitrogen-based fertilizer applications. Chronic toxicity studies conducted with ammonia determined that deformities and delayed development of R. pipiens, B. americanus, and R. clamitans resulted from chronic exposures conducted over the course of larval development to metamorphosis. Uncertainties posed by that study arose from inconsistent dosing as well as high control mortality. Limited testing suggests that water quality criteria for ammonia are likely to be protective of amphibians, yet limited information about the effects of exposure to stream dwelling amphibians and the consequences of sublethal injuries precludes verification.	Toxicity in Stream-Dwelling Amphibians	Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the LC50, EC10, EC20, LOEC and NOEC values for ammonia, and two reference chemicals, sodium chloride and potassium chloride to stream dwelling amphibian species endemic to watersheds of the Great Lakes (Necturus maculosus (mud puppy) and Eurycea bislineata (two lined salamander).

Determination of the Sensitivity of Two Species of Amphibians to Toxicity From Nitrate, Nitrite and Ammonia	Region 5 is working with the States and Tribes to develop water quality criteria for nutrients.  Most of that work is focusing on the indirect effect nutrients have on aquatic communities through organic enrichment.  However, one of the Region 5 states recently began to review lab and field data to determine if one form of nitrogen may be having a direct toxic effect.  The available data reviewed by the state suggests that amphibians may be sensitive to chronic exposures of nitrate, and they appear to be one of the most sensitive groups of organisms tested.  Given that (1) human activities have increased the concentrations of numerous forms of nitrogen in the environment, (2) the form of nitrogen in the environment is dependant on human activities and natural processes that transform one form of nitrogen to another, and (3) the general lack of toxicity data for amphibians, this project will generate data for the three forms of nitrogen that are present in the environment and may cause toxicity to aquatic life (nitrate, nitrite and ammonia).  This information can be used by EPA, the Great Lakes States and Tribes in the development of water quality criteria to protect amphibians and other aquatic life and will be used to determine if existing criteria are sufficiently protective of this important group of aquatic animals.	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	EPA	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/toxic_substances/EPA_toxicity_studies.html	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	In Progress	2010	2014

Alterations to the Great Lakes shoreline or water-level patterns associated with global climate change could have significant impacts on the extent and composition of coastal habitat.  Low lake levels can expose fertile wetland bottomlands to invasive species such as common reed (Phragmites).	Forecasting Potential Phragmites Coastal Invasion Corridors	A map of the current Phragmites distribution along the US Great Lakes coastal zone (10-km buffer inland from shore) was generated and published as a management decision-support tool.  This map can be used to understand the large-scale factors influencing Phragmites distribution, such as, but not limited to, nutrient loading to the coastal zone, proximity to urban and agricultural land-use types, shoreline development, slope and topography, and water depth.  The major influencing factors were used to develop a GIS modeling framework to identify areas vulnerable to invasion by Phragmites.

This pilot project will develop  approaches that will restore coastal wetland function and increase ecosystem resilience to be used as a model throughout the Great Lakes basin. USGS will focus on restoring natural hydrologic processes in diked coastal wetlands adjacent to Great Lakes waters to improve wetland functions like phosphorus retention and restoration of habitats for fish and wildlife.  Sustainable approaches are being developed in the Maumee River Area of Concern (AOC) to restore the hydrology and other processes that drive coastal wetland functions and increase ecosystem resiliency.  Results will be evaluated within an adaptive management framework and integrated with similar sites in the Saginaw River/Bay AOC and throughout the Great Lakes basin. Since the connection to the wetland was restored, the abundance and diversity of fish using the wetland habitats has exploded.  Northern pike and other recreationally and commercially valued species are again using the 40 ha wetland for reproduction and feeding.  Bird usage by waterfowl and several listed species is extensive.  Preliminary water-quality data indicate that the water exiting the wetland back into the Maumee River AOC had significantly less phosphorus and other nutrients than the incoming water, which has very positive implications for the water quality BUI for the Maumee River AOC.  Additional samples taken through FY 2013 will characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of fish use, nutrient retention, and other important wetland processes.  Coordinated efforts with the coastal wetland monitoring program, data collection efforts identified in Remedial Action Plans, NOAA-funded habitat restoration projects, and The Nature Conservancy to help guide regional restoration strategies and maximize basin-wide impact of locally-important projects.	New Strategies for Restoring Coastal Wetland Function, Maumee River Area of Concern	The purposes of the project are to: 1) hydrologically reconnect a diked wetland to Lake Erie to restore coastal wetland function and native species habitats; 2) implement a short- and long-term monitoring program to characterize response of biotic and abiotic ecosystem elements, especially those relating to Beneficial Use Impairments (e.g., phosphorus retention) after restoration actions, and 3) communicate project results to researchers, managers, policy makers, and the general public to ensure that outcomes of the project can: a) guide future management and restoration efforts in western Lake Erie and throughout the Great Lakes basin; b)  contribute to landscape-level efforts to improve ecosystem resiliency to stressors, and c) support implementation of sustainable and adaptive management strategies.	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	USGS Great Lakes Science Center	http://www.glsc.usgs.gov/	U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge	http://www.fws.gov/refuge/ottawa/	SUNY - Brockport	http://www.brockport.edu/envsci/faculty/wilcox.html	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) -New Strategies for Restoring Coastal Wetland Functions, Maumee River AOC [project overview]	https://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/habitat_and_wildlife/wetland_functions.html	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	In Progress	2010	unspecified

New innovative control options that sustainably target the competitive advantage often enjoyed by Phragmites and other invasive plants will contribute to a broad Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy.  This project targets the microorganisms that may help Phragmites spread and will employ a molecular genetic approach to silence the genes in Phragmites that give it a competitive edge over many native plants.  This project helped build and will continue to be closely aligned with the Great Lakes Phragmites Collaborative (url:greatlakesphragmites.net) that focuses on the people side of Phragmites IPM.  Additional collaborative groups (e.g., Collaborative for Microbial Symbiosis and Phragmites Management) are being created through this work. Into FY2014 we will use the encouraging results of this project to emphasize how this work adds several new dimensions to the IPM strategy for Phragmites and other invasive plant species.  The project will continue development of the Collaborative for Microbial Symbiosis and Phragmites Management, including completion of a science agenda for microbial symbiosis research.  Fungal endophytes will be isolated and sequenced from several Phragmites stands and experiments to test endophyte-control and soil-restoration strategies will be initiated at field sites located in or near AOCs.  Bacterial endophytes in Phragmites will be analyzed and their role in nitrogen fixation will be studied to explore contributions to the invasion process.  Similarly, transcriptome data for Phragmites will be analyzed to identify target gene sequences for silencing.  Experiments will be conducted to refine vectors for Phragmites and explore how other invasive plants (e.g., Oriental Bittersweet) could be managed by silencing select genes.  Finally, the regulatory hurdles for implementation of new control strategies will be examined.	Invasive Phragmites: Prevention, Monitoring, and Control Strategies in an Integrated Pest Management Framework	Phragmites continues to spread throughout the Great Lakes and have negative impacts on coastal resources including critical fish and wildlife habitat and coastal viewscapes.  Current control strategies are time, labor, and resource intensive, so innovative methods to control the spread of Phragmites or minimize its invasive properties are needed.  This study will test new strategies to reduce the invasive properties of Phragmites and minimize its competitive advantage. Results of this project will be used to guide future proposals focused on potential implementation strategies for using successful techniques to control the invasive Phragmites haplotype M.  Results also will promote information sharing, technology transfer, management efficiency, and collaborations among those focused on Phragmites in the Great Lakes basin.	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	The Great Lakes Commission	http://glc.org/	Wayne State University	https://wayne.edu/	SUNY – Brockport	http://recapitulation/envsci/faculty/wilcox.html	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) - Innovative Phragmites Control Strategies [project overview]	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/invasive_species/Phragmites_control.html	Great Lakes Phragmites Collaborative	http://greatlakesphragmites.net/	Great Lakes Phragmites Collaborative – Research: biocontrol	http://greatlakesphragmites.net/control-options/	In Progress	2010	unspecified

Nevers	unspecified	unspecified	Project	beach closings	E. coli	area of concern	hydrodynamics	sewage contamination	environmental justice	unspecified	unspecified	GLRI	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative	unspecified	Lake	Lake:Lake Michigan	Toxic Substances	Jeorse Park Beach is located in East Chicago, Indiana, within the Grand Calumet River Area of Concern (AOC), which has been identified as having all 14 beneficial use designations impaired, including beach closings.  Jeorse Park Beach has been identified as one of the most highly contaminated beaches in the nation, with annual beach closings due to bacterial contamination as high as 76% in 2010.  Further, beach closings have steadily increased each year since beach monitoring was initiated in 2005 in response to the Beaches Environmental and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act.  Beach closings represent an environmental, social, and economic burden, the alleviation of which require various remediation strategies targeted to specific sources of microbiological contamination. Research by USGS at Jeorse Park Beach in cooperation with the State of Indiana has identified dual factors contributing to beach closings: (1) the enclosed circulation of the beach area prevents contaminants from moving out of the embayment and (2) resident shore birds (geese, gulls) are a significant source of fecal contamination to the swimming water.  In addition to bird contamination, evidence of human sewage contamination has also been found at this beach.  The presence of additional sources of contamination, originating within or outside of the beach, and the influence of beach circulation patterns on retaining and influencing the persistence of these bacteria remain unknown.	Jeorse Park Beach Contamination	In this study, we propose to investigate the processes by which contamination is carried to the beach and retained.  Work conducted in Phase I indicated potential sources of contamination, but an understanding of currents and their influence on contaminant advection and distribution is needed to determine restoration strategies and potential for success.We propose to investigate the sources of high concentrations of indicator bacteria at Jeorse Park Beach and the relative influence of these potentially varied sources on beach water quality.  .  If these rivers are releasing high concentrations of bacteria into the lake, there is a potential for nearshore currents to carry these contaminants to the Jeorse Park Beach, where they may become trapped in by embayment circulation patterns in the nearshore.  With the results of this project, beach managers will have the necessary tools to pursue remediation of contaminants and therefore reduce the number of beach closings.  Because of the frequency of the problem, results of this project could be transferred to benefit hundreds of beaches throughout the Great Lakes and coastal waters nationally.  Benefits of a reduction in beach closures include decreased human health risk, increased recreational access, and the promotion of economic opportunities.	-85.0160283	45.04062017	TRUE	-93.28344726	40.86835632	-75.52954101	49.25750104	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	unspecified	Great Lakes Restoration Initiative	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	unspecified	http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/	In Progress	2012	unspecified
