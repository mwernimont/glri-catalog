<div class="strong2">Background/Problem</div><br />

<p>Societal needs are now commonly including questions such as how to protect 
the integrity of restoration efforts and flow regimes under conditions of 
changing climate, evolving landscapes, and increasing demand on resources. The 
hydrologic simulation models and methods required to support this level of 
decision making must be scientifically sound, reduce duplication of effort, and 
promote interdisciplinary problem solving.</p>

<p>
Currently, there is a lack of science-based tools for forecasting changes to 
water flows and select ecological endpoints (e.g., species abundance and 
distribution, habitat availability and distribution, ecological functions) in 
Great Lakes watersheds. Societal decisions can be better informed by evaluating 
effects of future climate drivers, as well as other potential important drivers 
such as land use change and invasive species introduction. If such tools were 
widely available in the Great Lakes, they would be well suited for linking to 
other GLRI elements including road and urban infrastructure design, habitat 
change, restoration potential, native species enhancement efforts, human health, 
wildlife health, beach health, and invasive species establishment and 
persistence.</p>

<p>The primary FY10 work element involves large-scale characterization of the 
Lake Michigan Basin (LMB). The U.S. Geological Survey Modeling of Watershed 
Systems (MoWS) Project has proposed the development of a National Hydrologic 
Modeling Structure (NHMS) to support coordinated, conceptually consistent, and 
robust hydrologic model development. The NHMS addresses four important aspects 
which must be considered for a relevant, comprehensive and successful 
hydrologic-modeling program. These include:</p>

<ul id="list-normal">
<li>Development of standard methods which can be applied to produce consistent 
and comparable hydrologic model studies, regardless of the specific model, 
geographic region, or study purpose.</li>
<li>Development of technology which makes the best available data readily 
accessible to hydrologic modelers. This includes dissemination of results from 
model studies in a consistent and efficient manner. As a principal provider and 
consumer of earth science data, the USGS should be a leader in these 
technologies.</li>
<li>Relevant research and development in the field of hydrologic modeling to 
adapt to the increasingly complex questions, and to take advantage of improved 
data sources as they become available.</li>
<li>Development of a modeling archive process that provides a platform for model 
distribution, comparability, and interoperability.</li>
</ul>


<p>The National Hydrologic Modeling Structure is a set of integrating methods 
for building models, tools, and data. For instance, the geographic extent of 
fine-scale model applications must “nest” within the extent of coarser-scaled 
regional models. The GLRI climate modeling project will act as a test bed for 
the National Hydrologic Modeling Project approach, and will develop the 
coarse-scale Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS – Leavesley and others, 
1983; Regan and others, in review) model within the framework of the National 
Hydrologic Modeling Structure using the MoWS resources funded by others.</p>
<p>In addition to hydrological flows, ecological endpoints of societal interest 
are important metrics for assessing the effect of climate and land use change on 
the Great Lakes ecosystem and restoration. Therefore, a secondary work element 
is needed to relate forecast potential changes in important ecological drivers 
that result from climate and land-use change scenarios. A regional SPAtially 
Referenced Regression On Watershed attributes model (Great Lakes SPARROW model, 
funded by USGS NAWQA; D. Robertson, written commun., 2009) estimates nutrient 
loads to surface water systems based on nutrient sources and environmental 
characteristics of the landscape. The SPARROW model as currently implemented 
(Alexander and others, 2008) cannot accommodate a modification to the hydrologic 
flow for which the model was calibrated such as that may occur with climate 
change. A secondary work element involving an extension of SPARROW (called 
HydroSPARROW here for clarity) will address this limitation. HydroSPARROW will 
link the existing SPARROW model with several water-quantity models, including 
the GIS spatially interpolated model used to estimate streamflow used in the 
SPARROW model and stand-alone models such as WATER (based on TOPMODEL) and the 
PRMS model developed as part of this project. The GIS spatially interpolated 
model estimates streamflow throughout the basin using flow measured at existing 
USGS gages assuming a similar yield throughout the area upstream of each gage. . 
WATER and PRMS estimate streamflow throughout the basin on the basis of 
meteorological forcing, and specific topographic and land cover features, which 
enable the models to incorporate the effects of various land-use and 
climate-change scenarios. The introduction of hydrologic flows, and changes to 
flows, will allow us to extend simulated changes in flows due to climate and 
land-use change to estimates of nutrient loads to receiving surface waters in 
the Great Lakes Basin.</p>
<p>A second ecological/restoration endpoint of societal interest is the effect 
of climate and land use change on wildlife health in the basin. The USGS 
National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, has multiple-year 
historical data on disease in the Great Lakes Basin. However, this information 
has not been put in the context of the hydrologic flows, and expected changes in 
flows.</p>


<div style="border-bottom:solid #ECECEC 1px;"></div><br />

<div class="strong2">Objectives/Scope</div><br />

<p>The primary goal is to develop and combine hydrologic models of the Great 
Lakes Basin suitable for accepting downscaled climate and land-use change 
inputs, and that produce hydrologic flows suitable for restoration, water 
quantity, water quality, infrastructure, habitat, and other ecological 
forecasting. This will facilitate science-based assessments of the impact of 
climate and land use change on the ecological response at a Great Lakes scale.</p>
<p>Specific objectives for FY2010 are as follows:</p>

<ul id="list-normal">
<li>Build and calibrate a coarse-scale Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) 
model of the Lake Michigan Watershed using data from USGS least-impacted stream 
gages as calibration targets. Develop model calibration methodologies 
specifically designed to address the ecological and restoration focus of the 
models.</li>
<li>Evaluate existing evapotranspiration algorithms and develop a new 
frozen-ground module for the PRMS model.</li>
<li>Simulate impacts of climate change on streams in the Lake Michigan Watershed 
using down-scaled climate-change predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment report.</li>
<li>Build one fine-scaled PRMS inset model within the framework of the 
coarse-scale model to investigate local impacts of climate change in areas of 
interest to stakeholders.</li>
<li>Relate PRMS climate and land-use change flows to SPARROW nutrient loads. 
Begin work on a TOPMODEL hydrologic flow model of the Great Lakes Basin.</li>
<li>Relate historical wildlife disease data to hydrological indices simulated by 
the watershed models. Use the relation to forecast changes in disease occurrence 
and distribution that may result from changes in hydrology due to climate and 
land-use change.</li>
</ul>

<div style="border-bottom:solid #ECECEC 1px;">
	<p><b>Questions that will be answered to support restoration in the Great 
	Lakes:</b> The purpose of this project is to answer potential questions 
	about the long-term viability of present day restoration investments given 
	the potential for land use and climate change. Such work helps ensure that 
	public and other funds are not directed to restoration projects that have 
	little likelihood of being self-sufficient and viable over societally 
	relevant time scales. This purpose is important in that it is unlikely 
	future funding will be sufficient to support long-term actively managed 
	restoration activities on the Great Lakes scale.</p></div>
<p><br />

</p>

<div class="strong2">Approach</div><br />

<p><b>Objective 1:</b> The U.S. Geological Survey Precipitation-Runoff Modeling 
System (PRMS) will be used as the basis for the climate change hydrologic 
modeling. The PRMS model uses hydrologic response units (HRUs) to partition the 
watershed into areas with relatively uniform hydrologic response. As a pilot for 
the National Hydrologic Model (NHM), we will work with the MoWS group to develop 
the coarse-scale model using the NHM framework. At its coarsest resolution, the 
NHM will be made up of HRUs based on reference stream gages (1000+ reference 
gages within the U.S. identified by David Wolock to be free of anthropogenic 
effects). Additional real-world geographic locations, such as outlets of 
reservoirs, confluences of rivers, etc. will be used to help ensure consistency 
when nesting model applications. For the Lake Michigan model, this will include 
stream locations with previous estimates of loading to provide a calibration 
baseline for climate-change predictions using the SPARROW framework, and all of 
the tributary streams that flow into the lake.</p>
<p>The model will be calibrated using the PEST suite of automated calibration 
software (Doherty, 2010) using a series of least-impacted USGS stream gages as 
calibration targets. We will also use large-scale datasets of solar radiation 
and potential evapotranspiration as calibration targets. A step-wise procedure 
similar to that described in Hay and others (2006) will be used to perform the 
calibration. The first three steps for calibration (solar radiation, potential 
ET, annual water balance) will be carried out for the entire model. The final 
step (monthly water balance, daily flow targets) will be carried out in parts, 
defined by sub basins in the model. In cases where sub basins are nested, the 
upstream sub basin will be calibrated first; the parameters in that sub basin 
will be fixed, and the next downstream sub basin will be calibrated. This 
procedure will be continued until the confluence with Lake Michigan is reached.</p>
<p><b>Objective 2: </b>The current version of PRMS has two algorithms for 
calculating potential evapotranspiration (PET), which may not provide enough 
spatial variability across large-scale watersheds. Further, both algorithms rely 
on temperature and solar radiation as inputs, and it is not clear if the 
parameters calibrated for a particular climate will apply to an altered climate. 
We will investigate the two PRMS algorithms along with numerous additional 
algorithms and determine the best approach to be used for current and future 
climate conditions. The PRMS model will be modified to use the selected 
algorithm.</p>
<p>The current version of PRMS does not consider frozen ground. This could be 
simply simulated by adjusting soil-property parameters to reflect the hydrologic 
response to frozen ground. In reality, frozen ground and the interaction of the 
surface and subsurface flow paths are much more complicated. A frozen ground 
module will be developed (Andrew Slater, NSIDC) for incorporation into PRMS 
using a combination of GLRI and MoWS funds.</p>
<p><b>Objective 3:</b> Current efforts for the NHM include developing tools for 
processing spatial datasets and returning values for selected polygons. There 
will be several datasets developed with down-scaled climate data culled from the 
IPCC Fourth Assessment (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007). The 
spatial data processing tool will be used to develop an input data set for PRMS 
with downscaled climate for each model HRU. The Fourth assessment included 
results from 15 global climate models (GCMs) run for current conditions and 
three emissions scenarios. The PRMS model will then be run using the various GCM 
and emissions scenario combinations, and compared to results for the current 
climate to determine the impacts of climate change on streamflow in the Lake 
Michigan watershed. It is anticipated that the coarse-scale model will give 
representative results at a monthly time scale.</p>
<p><b>Objective 4:</b> The first order NHM HRUs will be further discretized into 
a standalone fine-scale hydrologic modelfor one area of interest. The area of 
interest will be selected based on input from stakeholders in the watershed. The 
PRMS model developed at resolutions finer than the coarse resolution Lake 
Michigan model will begin by initialization from the set of parameters resulting 
from calibration in Objective 1. This ensures consistency and quality because 
the finer resolution model will never have more uncertainty in terms of model 
misfit compared to the coarse scale model.</p>
<p>Anthropogenic factors will be incorporated at the appropriate model 
resolution. In this manner, the selected higher resolution hydrologic models 
will be nested within HRUs of coarser resolution hydrologic models. An example 
of nested scales and model HRUs from the NHM is shown in Figure 2.</p>

<p><b>Objective 5:</b> Develop HydroSPARROW, to estimate nutrient concentrations 
in streams throughout the Great Lakes Basin and loading to the Great Lakes from 
each tributary in response to the changes in climate and land use. HydroSPARROW 
will be an extension of the existing SPARROW model to accommodate changing 
hydrologic flow. This extension will link the existing SPARROW model with 
several water-quantity models, including the GIS spatially interpolated model 
used to estimate streamflow used in the SPARROW model (D. Wolock, USGS, person. 
commun.) and stand-alone models WATER (based on TOPMODEL) and the PRMS model 
developed as part of this project. The GIS spatially interpolated model 
estimates streamflow throughout the basin using flow measured at existing USGS 
gages assuming a similar yield throughout each basin. WATER and PRMS estimate 
streamflow throughout the basin on the basis of meteorological forcing, and 
specific topographic and land cover features, which enable the models to 
incorporate the effects of various land-use and climate-change scenarios. The 
introduction of hydrologic flows, and changes to flows, will allow estimates of 
future nutrient loading using SPARROW-calculated.</p>
<p><b>Objective 6:</b> A pilot effort to relate USGS National Wildlife Health 
Center data to simulated historical and future change flows will be conducted. 
Indices of hydrologic alteration metrics will be compared to historical spatial 
and temporal changes in wildlife disease in the Lake Michigan Basin. From these 
initial relations, preliminary forecasts of how land and climate changed flows 
affect wildlife disease can be made. Depending on the explanatory power of the 
relation, additional ecological metrics may be included in future work.</p>
